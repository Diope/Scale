# Scale

A very simple app that uses the force touch capacities of iPhone 6s/iPhone 6 Plus S to weigh how much any object is that is on the surface. Unfortunately because the 3D touch capacities are naturally tied to touchesBegin & touchesEnd you can not simply set an object on the phone, it will not register the capacitive touch. 

Still a fun activity, I admit to getting help to do this via Stack Overflow. Definitely not able to think of this off the top of my head without needing any help.
